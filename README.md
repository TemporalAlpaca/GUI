# Description
"Wake up, it's Tuesday" is a third person coliseum fighting game. The gameplay and style are akin to Super Nintendo titles such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana (screenshots of those games are posted in the Screenshot section). The game is centered around a man owned by a coliseum which boasts one fight each day of the week. Each successive win guarantees your survival; well, at least until next week. Developed using Unity.

#Technologies
Developed in the Unity platform with C#.

#Bugs/To-do
The game has reached a stage where most core functionality is present. Movement, attacking, and a damage system are all in place and are relatively bug free. Animations and sounds are also present in the game which give feedback to the user.

#Contributors

#Credit/Inspiration
Inspiration from the game is derived from older RPG titles (as seen above) which succeeded greatly in fluid gameplay and subtle storytelling. The aim of Wake up it's Tuesday is to provide a sense of mystery and allow the player to discover their circumstances without walls of text.

Licensing information will be updated as the game continues development.
