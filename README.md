# Description
"Wake up, it's Tuesday" is a third person coliseum fighting game. The gameplay and style are akin to Super Nintendo titles such as The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Secret of Mana (screenshots of those games are posted in the Credit/Inspriation section). The game is centered around a man owned by a coliseum which boasts one fight each day of the week. Each successive win guarantees your survival; well, at least until next week. Developed using Unity.

#Technologies
Developed in the Unity platform with Java.
